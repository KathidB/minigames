### Guess the number

The function generates a random number between 0 and 100. The player's task is to guess what number it is. The player's moves are counted. After winning, a reset button appears, and you can start the game again. The function accepts only numbers. 

### Rock, paper and scissors

Stone Paper and Scissors.
After selecting the indicated item, the function adds it to the selection box and automatically selects a random one for the computer.
<br> The player's choice is compared to the computer's choice, and a score is assigned based on that choice.
<br> The game is played for up to 10 points. After one side has scored 10 points, a winner is determined, and the game can be reset.
